# Isti115's dotfiles

The `master` branch currently contains the subset of my configurations that were committed using the [bare repo approach](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) before I started using [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io).
I might also add / move things here later on for archival purposes.

See more up-to-date content at the [`chezmoi` branch](https://github.com/Isti115/dotfiles/tree/chezmoi)!

> [!NOTE]
> Not all files were migrated, since I have gone through lots of changes in my software choices over the last few years, and most of the old configuration is pretty much abandoned at this point.

> [!TIP]
> For future me, to get started in a new environment:
> ```
> chezmoi init github.com/isti115/dotfiles --branch chezmoi
> ```
